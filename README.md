# Understanding Express.js and Sequelize Integration

## Setting Up Express.js

- **Basics of creating an Express server.**
- **Routing in Express for handling API requests.**

## Using Sequelize

- **Setting up Sequelize to connect to a PostgreSQL database.**
- **Defining Sequelize models to map to database tables.**
- **Configuring environment variables to manage database credentials securely.**
- **Synchronizing Sequelize models with the database using sequelize.sync().**

## CRUD Operations with Express.js and Sequelize

### GET Requests

- **Fetching data from the database using Sequelize’s findAll and findByPk methods.**
- **Handling and returning data in JSON format.**

### POST Requests

- **Creating new records in the database using Sequelize’s create method.**
- **Validating input data before inserting it into the database.**

### PUT Requests

- **Updating existing records using Sequelize’s update method.**
- **Handling partial updates and ensuring the correct record is modified.**

### DELETE Requests

- **Deleting records from the database using Sequelize’s destroy method.**
- **Handling cases where records do not exist.**

## Error Handling, Validation, Debugging, and Logging

- **Utilizing console.log for debugging purposes and identifying issues.**
- **Implementing error-handling middleware in Express to catch and respond to errors.**
- **Using Sequelize’s built-in validation to enforce data integrity.**
- **Understanding SequelizeValidationError and handling it in the API responses.**
- **I had to debug my code because my PUT and DELETE routes weren't working on the Tag and Product models. By reworking the code to align with proper CRUD operations and ensuring the correct models and information were being exported and imported, I managed to resolve the issues.**

## Database Management

### Sequelize Migrations

- **Using Sequelize CLI to create and manage database migrations.**
- **Understanding the purpose of migrations in evolving database schema.**

### Sequelize Seed Files

- **Creating and running seed files to populate the database with initial or test data.**

## API Testing

### Using Insomnia

- **Testing various API endpoints to ensure they perform as expected.**
- **Sending different types of requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and analyzing responses.**
- **Configuring request headers and bodies correctly.**

## Best Practices and Tools

### Environment Variables

- **Securing sensitive information like database credentials using environment variables.**
- **Utilizing dotenv to manage configuration settings.**

### Code Organization

- **Structuring the project into logical components (e.g., models, routes, controllers).**
- **Keeping API routes and logic modular and maintainable.**

### Error Responses

- **Returning meaningful error messages and status codes to clients.**
- **Ensuring consistent response formats for better client-side handling.**

## Project Management

### Version Control

- **Using Git for version control and managing code changes.**
- **Understanding basic Git commands for committing and pushing changes.**


## Additional Skills

### Basic SQL Knowledge

- **Understanding SQL basics to work effectively with PostgreSQL.**
- **Knowing how to perform common SQL operations and queries.**

### Understanding RESTful API Principles

- **Designing APIs based on RESTful principles.**
- **Knowing the purpose and use of different HTTP methods.**
